Summary of Completed BlockMover Implementation



&nbsp; ✅ Design and implement BlockMover header file



&nbsp; - Created /mnt/c/Users/tomtz/dev/stillwater/clones/KPU-simulator/include/sw/memory/block\_mover.hpp

&nbsp; - Implemented transformation engine architecture with support for:

&nbsp;   - Identity copy (direct transfer)

&nbsp;   - Matrix transpose operations

&nbsp;   - Block reshape (placeholder for future)

&nbsp;   - Shuffle pattern operations (placeholder for future)



&nbsp; ✅ Implement BlockMover class with basic identity transfers



&nbsp; - Created supporting L3Tile and L2Bank classes for hierarchical memory

&nbsp; - Implemented BlockMover with queue-based transfer processing

&nbsp; - Added 2D block geometry support with configurable transformations



&nbsp; ✅ Create L3Tile and L2Bank classes to support BlockMover



&nbsp; - L3Tile: Distributed L3 cache tiles with 2D block operations

&nbsp; - L2Bank: L2 cache banks with cache line and block operations

&nbsp; - Both support configurable capacities and memory management



&nbsp; ✅ Update KPUSimulator to integrate BlockMover functionality



&nbsp; - Added L3 tiles, L2 banks, and BlockMovers to KPUSimulator configuration

&nbsp; - Implemented complete API integration following existing patterns

&nbsp; - Added validation, status queries, and lifecycle management

&nbsp; - Updated simulation step processing and idle detection



&nbsp; ✅ Create basic BlockMover tests



&nbsp; - Comprehensive test suite with 9 test cases covering:

&nbsp;   - Basic Transfer: Identity copy operations

&nbsp;   - Matrix Transpose: Transformation engine testing

&nbsp;   - Queue Management: Multiple transfer handling

&nbsp;   - Data Integrity: Various block sizes validation

&nbsp;   - Error Handling: Invalid ID and boundary condition testing

&nbsp;   - Reset Functionality: Simulation state management

&nbsp;   - Concurrent Operations: Multi-BlockMover coordination

&nbsp;   - Large Matrix Operations: Performance stress testing

&nbsp;   - Status and Configuration: API validation



&nbsp; Key Features Implemented:



&nbsp; 1. Hardware-realistic architecture with L3↔L2 data movement

&nbsp; 2. Transformation engine supporting identity and transpose operations

&nbsp; 3. 2D block geometry support for matrix and tensor operations

&nbsp; 4. Queue-based processing for concurrent transfer management

&nbsp; 5. Complete integration with KPUSimulator following established patterns

&nbsp; 6. Comprehensive testing with 36 assertions across 9 test cases



&nbsp; The BlockMover implementation successfully provides the foundation for hierarchical memory data movement in the

&nbsp; KPU simulator, enabling efficient L3 to L2 cache transfers with data transformations as requested in the original

&nbsp; specification.
