Real-World DMA Engine Design



&nbsp; Most DMA engines are bidirectional by nature:



&nbsp; 1. Hardware DMA Controllers (like those in ARM, x86, or custom ASICs) typically support transfers in any direction

&nbsp;  between any addressable memory spaces

&nbsp; 2. GPU DMA Engines can move data Host↔Device, Device↔Device in either direction

&nbsp; 3. Network DMA (RDMA, etc.) handles both ingress and egress through the same engine

&nbsp; 4. Modern SoC DMA controllers are configured per-transfer, not per-engine



&nbsp; Current Design Problems



&nbsp; The current fixed-direction design creates several issues:



&nbsp; 1. Resource Utilization: Half the DMA engines may be idle while the other half are overloaded

&nbsp; 2. Configuration Complexity: Developers must know which DMA ID does what direction

&nbsp; 3. Bug Potential: Exactly what we hit - using wrong DMA for wrong direction

&nbsp; 4. Scalability: Adding more memory banks requires careful DMA mapping

&nbsp; 5. Realistic Modeling: Doesn't match real hardware behavior



&nbsp; Better Design Approach



&nbsp; DMA engines should be configured per-transfer, not per-engine:



&nbsp; // Current (problematic):

&nbsp; DMAEngine(MemoryType src\_type, size\_t src\_id, MemoryType dst\_type, size\_t dst\_id)



&nbsp; // Better:

&nbsp; void start\_dma\_transfer(size\_t dma\_id,

&nbsp;                        MemoryType src\_type, size\_t src\_id, Address src\_addr,

&nbsp;                        MemoryType dst\_type, size\_t dst\_id, Address dst\_addr,

&nbsp;                        Size size, callback);



&nbsp; This would:

&nbsp; - ✅ Match real hardware where DMA engines are direction-agnostic

&nbsp; - ✅ Eliminate configuration bugs

&nbsp; - ✅ Improve resource utilization

&nbsp; - ✅ Simplify test code

&nbsp; - ✅ Scale better with more memory banks
