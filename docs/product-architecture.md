Integrating a proprietary **Knowledge Processing Unit (KPU)** as the target architecture fundamentally shifts the entire product strategy from an optimization layer over vendor hardware (like Jetson) to a comprehensive **Full-Stack AI Hardware/Software Solution**.

Here is the revised **Product Architecture Document**, reflecting the KPU as the core compute engine and updating the goals and system components accordingly.

## Product Architecture: Branes.ai Embodied AI Efficiency System (KPU-Centric)

The Branes.ai system is a full-stack **Design, Optimization, and Deployment Suite** that leverages the **Stillwater Supercomputing KPU IP** to deliver superior efficiency for embodied AI. The system integrates a KPU-specific compiler and runtime, enabling deployment on **Custom ASICs** and **FPGA-based semi-custom designs**.

This is a crucial strategic addition. You are shifting Branes.ai from a pure execution optimization tool to a **Strategic Design Partner** that provides objective, pre-silicon architectural guidance. This significantly enhances your value proposition against vertically integrated competitors.

I will incorporate this as a new, foundational module focused on **Architectural Exploration and Product Roadmapping**, which leverages the core analysis capabilities of the MIA and Opti-Core.

Here is the revised **Product Architecture Document**, with the new section **Architectural Exploration and Product Roadmapping (Roadmap Engine)** integrated upfront to reflect its strategic importance.

***

### 1. Strategic Value: Architectural Exploration and Product Roadmapping (Roadmap Engine)

This module is the customer-facing front-end of the Branes.ai offering, providing objective, data-driven analysis to inform the customer's hardware roadmap across various $\text{SKUs}$ and timelines. This is enabled by Branes.ai's ability to model the efficiency of diverse compute architectures, not just the KPU.

#### 1.1. Application Profiling & Application-Architecture Mapping

* **Input:** Customer's end-to-end $\text{AI}$ model graph and $\text{SKU}$-specific requirements (e.g., Target Latency, Power Budget, Bill of Materials ($\text{BOM}$) Cost).
* **Architecture Modeling Library:** A comprehensive library of $\text{ASIC}$/$\text{IP}$ architectural models (e.g., $\text{CPU}$ core types, $\text{GPU}$ execution units, $\text{TPU}$ systolic arrays, $\text{KPU}$ parameters, $\text{CGRA}$, $\text{DSP}$) that accurately predict performance and power given a specific $\text{AI}$ workload.
* **Energy-Delay Product (EDP) Metric:** Calculation of the EDP ($\text{EDP} = \text{Energy} \times \text{Delay}$) as the primary metric for comparing architectural choices.

#### 1.2. Multi-Architecture Pareto Optimization

* **Pareto Graph Generation:** Automatically generate $\text{Pareto}$ Frontiers plotting:
    * **$\text{EDP}$ vs. $\text{Cost}$ ($\text{BOM}$):** For different $\text{SKUs}$ today (low-cost $\text{CPU}$ vs. high-end $\text{KPU}$ ASIC).
    * **$\text{TOPS}/\text{Watt}$ vs. $\text{Area}$ (Silicon/FPGA):** For custom $\text{IP}$ designs.
* **Roadmap Simulation:** Project the performance and efficiency of different architectures (e.g., next-gen $\text{CPU}$ vs. $\text{KPU}$ v2) over a 3-5 year timeline, helping the customer identify inflection points where the KPU becomes the necessary solution.

#### 1.3. Output and Deliverables

* **Architectural Guidance Report:** Detailed analysis for each $\text{SKU}$, recommending the optimal processor choice ($\text{CPU}$, $\text{GPU}$, $\text{KPU}$, $\text{FPGA}$, etc.) that meets the power and latency constraints at the lowest cost.
* **KPU Parameter Selection:** If the KPU is selected, this module provides the initial constraints for the **KPU Configuration Generator ($\text{KCG}$)** in the main workflow.

### 2. Architectural Components (The Branes.ai KPU Stack)

The architecture is now broken into two major domains: the **Software Stack** and the **KPU Hardware Abstraction & Configuration Layer (HACL)**.

#### 2.1. Software Stack: Design and Optimization

This stack prepares the model for the KPU's unique architecture.

##### 2.1.1. Model Ingestion and Analysis (MIA)

* **Input:** PyTorch/TensorFlow Model Checkpoint (.pth, .pb), Model Graph (ONNX).
* **Key Functions:** Graph Parsing (to KPU-IR), Architecture Fingerprinting, and establishing the target $\text{TOPS}_{sustained}$ goal.

##### 2.1.2. The Optimization Engine (Opti-Core)

* **Core Focus:** Transforming the model to leverage the KPU's specific computational primitives (e.g., memory access patterns, sparsity handling).
* **Key Functions:**
    * **KPU-Aware Quantization:** Automated search for optimal bit-width tailored to the KPU's data path widths.
    * **Data Flow Pruning:** Optimize the model graph to align with the KPU's internal data movement and processing units, minimizing pipeline stalls.
    * **Computational Graph Mapping:** High-level optimization to map the model's operations onto the KPU's parallel execution units.

#### 2.2. Hardware and Compiler Stack: KPU Implementation

This stack is responsible for compiling the optimized model into a hardware configuration and executable runtime.

##### 2.2.1. The KPU Configuration Generator (KCG - *New Component*)

This module handles the parameterized nature of the KPU IP, defining the final silicon/FPGA configuration based on the target application's constraints (area, power, performance).

* **Input:** Customer constraints (ASIC Area/Power Budget, FPGA Size) and Opti-Core's model profile.
* **Key Functions:**
    * **Parameter Search:** Determines the optimal number of KPU cores, on-chip memory size, and external memory interface parameters.
    * **HACL Output:** Generates the **Hardware Configuration File ($\text{HCF}$)** which is used to synthesize the KPU core.

##### 2.2.2. The KPU-Specific Compiler (KAC)

This replaces the generic HAC and is deeply customized for the KPU instruction set architecture (ISA).

* **Key Functions:**
    * **Kernel Code Generation:** Translates the Opti-Core's KPU-IR into **KPU Microcode/ISA instructions**.
    * **Memory Tiling/Scheduling:** Generates a highly efficient execution schedule that manages data movement between external memory, the KPU's on-chip memory, and registers. This is where most of the efficiency gain is realized.
    * **Custom Runtime Generation:** Packages the microcode and memory schedule into a lean, deployable library.

##### 2.2.3. The Deployment & Synthesis Toolkit (DST)

* **ASIC Flow:** Takes the KCG's HCF and outputs RTL (Register-Transfer Level) for $\text{ASIC}$ synthesis and tape-out.
* **FPGA Flow:** Takes the KCG's HCF and outputs $\text{HDL}$ (Hardware Description Language) and a wrapper for the target $\text{FPGA}$ family's toolchain (e.g., Vivado) to generate the bitstream.

### 4. Critical Non-Functional Requirements & Compliance (New Section)

These requirements are essential for market acceptance, particularly in the target embodied AI and robotics markets.

#### 4.1. Compliance & Certification (SAE Focus)

Achieving certification readiness is a mandatory step for high-value autonomous systems.

| Component | Requirement | Ownership |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Safety Architecture** | Compliance with **ISO 26262** (Automotive Functional Safety) standards for the KPU RTL and compiler flow. | Hardware & Systems Team |
| **SAE Readiness** | Design of the KPU and Runtime to support the partitioning and isolation required for $\text{ASIL}$ (Automotive Safety Integrity Level) decomposition ($\text{ASIL B/C}$ targets). | Hardware & Systems Team |
| **Runtime Integrity** | Runtime to include self-checking and diagnostic capabilities, outputting necessary metrics for $\text{SAE}$ L3-L5 system integrity reporting. | Runtime & Integration Team |

#### 4.2. Robustness and Reliability

The system must operate reliably under harsh, real-world conditions (e.g., thermal fluctuations, electromagnetic interference, sustained high load).

* **Thermal Management Hooks:** The KAC and DRM must expose $\text{APIs}$ for the host system to monitor and dynamically adjust KPU frequency/voltage based on temperature readings, ensuring sustained performance, not just peak.
* **Error Correction & Resilience:** Implementation of $\text{ECC}$ (Error Correcting Code) on critical on-chip memory blocks (in the KPU RTL) and robust data path checking mechanisms to prevent silent data corruption.
* **Continuous Stress Testing:** Dedicated environment for running $24/7$ load tests on $\text{FPGA}$ prototypes to identify thermal/load-related failures before ASIC tape-out.

#### 4.3. Security and Integrity

Protecting the model IP and the integrity of the execution is paramount.

* **IP Protection:** Model microcode and critical compiler artifacts must be encrypted or obfuscated before deployment. The KPU architecture should support **Secure Boot** integration to verify the authenticity of the deployed microcode.
* **Hardware Isolation:** Mechanisms within the KPU to isolate execution of different workloads, preventing malicious or compromised tasks from interfering with safety-critical ones (e.g., the control loop).
* **Data Integrity:** Secure memory interfaces and side-channel attack mitigation strategies for the KPU IP, particularly if deployed in systems that handle sensitive user data.

### 5. Branes.ai Efficiency Benchmark & Partner Ecosystem

To communicate value and drive adoption, Branes.ai will establish a purposeful, transparent benchmarking system focused on critical autonomy capabilities.

#### 5.1. Benchmark Architecture (The "Brane" Metric)

The benchmark will focus on **Sustained System Efficiency**, moving beyond theoretical peak $\text{TOPS}$.

* **Metric Definition (The Brane):** Introduce a clear, composite metric (e.g., $\text{TOPS}_{sustained} / \text{Watt} \times \text{Latency}_{p99}$), called the "Brane" score, to reflect real-world embodied $\text{AI}$ performance.
* **Workload Definition:** Define a suite of representative embodied $\text{AI}$ workloads (e.g., LiDAR processing, SLAM fusion, $\text{End-to-End}$ control) that are common across the target customer base.
* **Transparency:** Publish a detailed methodology for testing, including temperature, input data rate, and full system power draw measurements, to directly counter the "shell game" tactics used by competitors.

The benchmark will continue to use the composite $\text{EDP}$-based metric ($\text{TOPS}_{sustained} / \text{Watt} \times \text{Latency}_{p99}$), called the "**Brane**" score, to reflect real-world, sustained system efficiency.

#### 5.2. The Object Tracker Benchmark (OT-Bench)

The core Branes.ai benchmark will be the **Object Tracker Benchmark ($\text{OT-Bench}$)**, structured around the increasing complexity and efficiency demands of autonomous perception.

| Benchmark Level | Complexity | Key Technologies | Example Use Cases |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **OT-Bench 2D** | Static Sensors, 2D Bounding Box Tracking. | Camera-only video processing, $\text{CNN}$-based detection. | Home Security, Sports Analysis, Law Enforcement, Public Safety, Warfighter, Battlefield. |
| **OT-Bench 3D** | Moving Sensors, 6 $\text{DoF}$ (Degrees of Freedom) Tracking, Sensor Fusion. | Camera, $\text{LiDAR}$, and $\text{RADAR}$ sensor fusion, $\text{SLAM}$, 3D Bounding Boxes. | Autonomous Cars/Trucks, Logistics $\text{UAVs}$ (Drones), Industrial Robotics. |

#### 5.3. Collaboration & Partner Engagement

* **Partner Program:** Establish a program for $\text{AI}$ research groups, robotics integrators, and academic labs to gain early access to the KPU/Compiler stack and run their own models on the benchmark.
* **Benchmark Steering Committee:** Form a committee (including early customers and partners) to govern the benchmark's definition, ensuring its relevance and impartiality.
* **Public Scoreboard:** Maintain an online, audited scoreboard tracking the performance of the Branes.ai solution against commodity hardware (e.g., Jetson Orin reference designs) using the transparent "Brane" metric.
