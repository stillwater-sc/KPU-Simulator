# Spatial Computing vs Domain Flow Architecture and Knowledge Processing Unit

**Spatial computing** is an umbrella term for a paradigm shift in human-computer interaction where machines retain and manipulate referents to real objects and spaces. It essentially blurs the line between the physical and digital worlds, enabling users to interact with computers in three dimensions rather than being confined to a 2D screen.

Key aspects of spatial computing include:

* **3D Context:** It integrates data, logic, and 3D-contextualized information to converge the physical and digital worlds.
* **Immersive Technologies:** It encompasses technologies like **Augmented Reality (AR)**, **Virtual Reality (VR)**, **Mixed Reality (MR)**, and **Extended Reality (XR)**.
* **Real-World Interaction:** It uses sensors (like cameras, depth cameras, and inertial measurement units) and computer vision to understand and map the physical environment, allowing digital content to interact seamlessly with the real world.
* **Applications:** It's used across various sectors for tasks such as virtual design reviews, industrial optimization, and immersive gaming.

### Difference from Stillwater Supercomputing's Technologies

The concepts from Stillwater Supercomputing—**Domain Flow Architecture (DFA)** and **Knowledge Processing Unit (KPU)**—are related to the **underlying hardware and execution model for high-performance computing**, particularly for machine learning and intelligent systems, which is a different domain than the user-facing interaction and environment blending of spatial computing.

| Feature | Spatial Computing | Stillwater's Domain Flow Architecture (DFA) / Knowledge Processing Unit (KPU) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Focus** | Human-computer interaction, merging digital and physical realities in a 3D space. | High-performance, low-power parallel processing architecture for intelligent systems, like machine learning. |
| **Role** | The user-facing experience and application of digital content in a real-world context. | The computational engine and execution model specialized for speed and energy efficiency in complex algorithms. |
| **Technology** | AR, VR, MR, computer vision, spatial mapping, sensors. | A specialized **distributed data flow machine** (KPU) with a corresponding execution model (DFA), designed to overcome limitations of traditional von Neumann architectures for highly parallel tasks. |
| **Goal** | To create more intuitive and immersive ways for humans to interact with digital information in their environment. | To achieve maximum **performance-per-watt** and high productivity for fine-grain parallel algorithms, such as those found in AI and machine learning. |

In summary, **spatial computing** is about *what* the user experiences—interacting with digital information blended into the real world—while the **Domain Flow Architecture** and **Knowledge Processing Unit** are Stillwater's specialized **hardware and programming methodology** for *how* complex intelligent systems, which might power a spatial computing application, execute computations efficiently.
