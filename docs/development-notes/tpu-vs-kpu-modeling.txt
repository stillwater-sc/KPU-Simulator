  What Should Be Modeled (Per Your Specification)

  TPU (Weight-Stationary):
  - Load weights into array registers (one-time setup)
  - Shift inputs through array (N×N register writes per input row)
  - Shift partial sums through array (N×N register writes per output)
  - Total: 3 matrices × N×N register writes

  KPU (Streaming Dataflow):
  - Stream weights through array (with token control: 1.5× energy)
  - Stream inputs through array (with token control: 1.5× energy)
  - Outputs stay local (no streaming)
  - Total: 2 matrices × 1.5× = 3× equivalent
