\# Systolic Array



Perfect! I have successfully implemented the hard-coded systolic array for matrix multiplication as requested.

&nbsp; Here's a summary of what was accomplished:



&nbsp; Systolic Array Implementation Complete ✅



&nbsp; Key Features Implemented:

&nbsp; - Parameterized systolic array with configurable rows/columns (default 16x16)

&nbsp; - Output-stationary schedule where matrices A and B are streamed in and result matrix C is accumulated

&nbsp; - ProcessingElement array with MAC operations and data propagation

&nbsp; - Horizontal and vertical buses for systolic data movement

&nbsp; - Diagonal bus infrastructure for C value evacuation

&nbsp; - L1 scratchpad interface integration

&nbsp; - ComputeFabric integration with systolic array as compute backend

&nbsp; - KPU simulator configuration with systolic array support



&nbsp; Architecture Components:

&nbsp; - SystolicArray class with 16x16 default configuration

&nbsp; - ProcessingElement class with output-stationary logic

&nbsp; - Bus propagation system (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)

&nbsp; - Matrix multiplication interface with scratchpad memory

&nbsp; - Full integration with existing KPU simulator infrastructure



&nbsp; Testing Results:

&nbsp; - ✅ Systolic Array Configuration Tests - All passed

&nbsp; - ✅ Matrix Multiplication Tests - Small and large matrices

&nbsp; - ✅ Error Handling Tests - Boundary conditions and resource conflicts

&nbsp; - ✅ Integration Tests - Full KPU simulator functionality

&nbsp; - ✅ All existing tests continue to pass (100% test suite)



&nbsp; Files Modified/Created:

&nbsp; - include/sw/kpu/components/systolic\_array.hpp - New systolic array header

&nbsp; - src/components/compute/systolic\_array.cpp - New systolic array implementation

&nbsp; - include/sw/kpu/components/compute\_fabric.hpp - Updated for systolic integration

&nbsp; - src/components/compute/compute\_fabric.cpp - Updated with systolic routing

&nbsp; - include/sw/kpu/kpu\_simulator.hpp - Added systolic configuration

&nbsp; - src/simulator/kpu\_simulator.cpp - Added systolic array support

&nbsp; - tests/systolic\_array/test\_systolic\_array.cpp - Comprehensive test suite

&nbsp; - tests/systolic\_array/CMakeLists.txt - Test configuration



&nbsp; This represents the first functional configuration of the KPU with a working compute fabric. The systolic array

&nbsp; can now perform matrix multiplications and is fully integrated with the memory hierarchy and simulation

&nbsp; infrastructure.
