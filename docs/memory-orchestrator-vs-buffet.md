# MemoryOrchestrator vs Buffet: Understanding the Distinction

## Overview

This document clarifies the distinction between two different memory orchestration concepts in the KPU simulator:

1. **MemoryOrchestrator** - Our current implementation for dense memory operations
2. **SparseBuffet** - The true Buffet implementation from Google's research (to be implemented)

## MemoryOrchestrator (Current Implementation)

### Purpose
The `MemoryOrchestrator` is designed for **dense matrix operations** and general-purpose memory hierarchy coordination using EDDO (Explicit Decoupled Data Orchestration).

### FSM Phases
```
PREFETCH  â†’ COMPUTE â†’ WRITEBACK â†’ SYNC
```

- **PREFETCH**: Asynchronously prefetch data into buffer banks from higher memory levels
- **COMPUTE**: Allow compute engines to access buffered data for processing
- **WRITEBACK**: Write computed results back to the memory hierarchy
- **SYNC**: Synchronization barrier to ensure phase completion before proceeding

### Target Operations
- Dense matrix multiplication (GEMM)
- Convolution operations
- Matrix transpose
- Block-structured data movement
- Multi-bank pipeline coordination

### Key Features
- Multi-bank buffer memory (configurable number of banks)
- Dependency-based command orchestration
- Integration with BlockMover and Streamer components
- Thread-safe operation with mutex synchronization
- Performance metrics and monitoring

### Usage Pattern
```cpp
MemoryOrchestrator orchestrator(orchestrator_id, num_banks, config);

// EDDO workflow example
EDDOWorkflowBuilder builder;
builder.prefetch(bank_0, src_addr, dst_addr, size)
       .compute(bank_1, compute_function)
       .writeback(bank_1, src_addr, dst_addr, size)
       .sync()
       .execute_on(orchestrator);
```

## SparseBuffet (To Be Implemented)

### Purpose
The `SparseBuffet` will implement the **true Buffet** from Google's research paper, specifically designed for **sparse tensor operations**.

### FSM Phases (From Original Paper)
```
FILL â†’ READ â†’ UPDATE â†’ SHRINK
```

- **FILL**: Fill buffer with sparse data, potentially with compression
- **READ**: Read operations on sparse data structures
- **UPDATE**: Update sparse tensor elements (insertions, deletions, modifications)
- **SHRINK**: Compact and reorganize sparse data to maintain efficiency

### Target Operations
- Sparse matrix multiplication (SpGEMM)
- Sparse tensor decomposition
- Graph neural network operations
- Sparse convolution
- Dynamic sparse data structure management

### Key Differences from MemoryOrchestrator
- Designed for **sparsity-aware** operations rather than dense blocks
- Uses **compression** and **dynamic data structures**
- Optimized for **irregular memory access patterns**
- Supports **online sparse data structure updates**
- Different FSM optimized for sparse workload characteristics

## Comparison Table

| Aspect | MemoryOrchestrator (Current) | SparseBuffet (Future) |
|--------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Target Data** | Dense matrices/tensors | Sparse matrices/tensors |
| **FSM Phases** | PREFETCHâ†’COMPUTEâ†’WRITEBACKâ†’SYNC | FILLâ†’READâ†’UPDATEâ†’SHRINK |
| **Memory Pattern** | Block-structured, predictable | Irregular, dynamic |
| **Compression** | No (dense data) | Yes (sparse representation) |
| **Access Pattern** | Sequential/strided within blocks | Random/scattered |
| **Use Cases** | Dense GEMM, conv2d, transpose | SpGEMM, GNN, sparse conv |
| **Data Structure** | Fixed-size banks | Dynamic sparse structures |
| **Update Model** | Batch processing | Online updates |

## Integration Strategy

Both components will coexist in the KPU architecture:

- [ ] Integration with sparse compute kernels

## Design Rationale

### Why Two Different Systems?

1. **Performance Optimization**: Dense and sparse operations have fundamentally different memory access patterns and optimization requirements.

2. **Algorithmic Differences**: The PREFETCH/COMPUTE/WRITEBACK pattern works well for dense blocks, while FILL/READ/UPDATE/SHRINK is optimized for sparse data lifecycle.

3. **Memory Efficiency**: Sparse operations need dynamic memory management and compression, while dense operations benefit from fixed-size bank allocation.

4. **Complexity Separation**: Keeping dense and sparse orchestration separate maintains code clarity and allows independent optimization.

## Future Evolution

As the KPU simulator evolves, we anticipate:

1. **Hybrid Operations**: Some workloads may benefit from coordinated dense+sparse operations
2. **Automatic Selection**: Runtime selection between MemoryOrchestrator and SparseBuffet based on data characteristics
3. **Unified Interface**: Higher-level APIs that abstract the choice between dense and sparse orchestration
4. **Hardware Co-design**: Both software patterns will inform future KPU hardware design decisions
